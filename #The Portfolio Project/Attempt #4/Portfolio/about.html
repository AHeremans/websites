        <img id="pfp" src="images/about.jpg" alt="">
        <p id="intro-short" style="margin-top: 3rem;"> As a moon bear, I roam the Asian forests, adorned with a
            distinctive
            crescent-shaped patch on my
            chest, earning me my name. My adaptability allows me to thrive in a range of habitats, from
            dense rainforests to lofty meadows. Yet, my world is under siege, as human activities pose
            threats like habitat loss, illegal hunting, and bear bile farming.
        </p>
        <ul id="intro-list">
            <li>Name: Thomas Ward</li>
            <li>Age: 24</li>
            <li>Occupation: Moon Bear</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="intro-long"> As a moon bear freelancing in the heart of the Asian wilderness, my solitary and
            adaptive
            nature has become my greatest asset. My shaggy black fur provides me with camouflage as I
            navigate the intricacies of the forest, and the white crescent on my chest serves as my
            unique calling card. In this vibrant ecosystem, I am a jack of all trades, contributing to
            the balance of nature as I forage for a diverse range of food, from succulent fruits to
            small prey, each day presenting a new opportunity.
            <br>
            My freelance journey, however, is not without its challenges. The encroachment of human
            activities threatens the tranquility of my woodland office. I must constantly adapt to the
            ever-changing landscape, honing my skills to survive in the face of habitat loss, human
            intrusion, and the dangers of the wild. Despite these trials, I am a symbol of resilience, a
            freelancer in the truest sense, living a life that blends harmony with nature and the
            struggle for survival in a world that is both awe-inspiring and precarious.
